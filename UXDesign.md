This document discusses different aspects of the user experience or **UX**.

The purpose of this repository is to evolve these concepts in a collaborative manner.

*Mirawatt's purpose is to gather, transport, and present energy consumption and usage information.
The primary application is to gather electrical consumption from in-home sensors,
and to present the gathered data, to consummers through the web, typically on a mobile platform.*

* Behavioral Objectives
* Cognitive Objectives
