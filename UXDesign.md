# Mirawatt UX -  User Experience Design


This document discusses different aspects of the user experience or **UX** for the mirawatt project.

The purpose of this repository is to evolve these concepts in a collaborative manner.

*Mirawatt's purpose is to gather, transport, and present energy consumption and usage information.
The primary application is to gather electrical consumption from in-home sensors,
and to present the gathered data, to consummers through the web, typically on a mobile platform.*

## Objectives
When we speak of users, we may want to distinguish two classes of intersted individuals.
Those which may be **interested in the platform and devices** themselves, in which case the main objective might be:

* Demontration of Device/Infrastructure capabilities

whereas for the **end consumer**, we might favor:

* Behavioral Objectives
* Cognitive Objectives


## Process

## Elements of visual design

* Color
  * Distinguishing between sensors
  * Highlight consumption (peaks)
* Visualization (Graphs)
    * Continuous line graphs
    * Vertical bar charts
    * Pie charts
    * Relative (Comparisons)
        * Correlation: with temperature
        * Time: Year-over-Year, Day of the week
        * Other Consumers: by friendship-graph (for gamification), or by categorization (metrics on dwelling size, consumption profile, geography)
* Units
    * Scope independance
    * Scope specific
    * Monetary
* Scale: 
    * when dynamic range is problematic...because the elasticity may not be related to magnitude.
    * Use of projection for incomplete periods.

## Elements of interactive design

* Data navigation
    * Selection of scope in time
    * Selection of sensor
    * Selection of account(s)

* Settings and preferences
    * Colors
    * Scales/Units
    * Pricing
